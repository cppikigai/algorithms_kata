# Algorithmic Kata
I've decided to practice solving algorithmic problems and will be posting my solutions in this repository. As I am a beginner, I'll start with basic exercises and progress to more advanced challenges. I will also try to keep notes and summaries in the source files for future reference.

For training, I'm using the popular platform LeetCode. Additionally, I will list the problems I've solved in this file with links and the literature I've used. Hopefully, this might be useful for someone else.
